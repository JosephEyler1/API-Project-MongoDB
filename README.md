# API SEARCH PROJECT

## Overview
This is my API project which allows users to do plenty of things relating to user interactivity! Several of these features are: 
Creating, editing, or deleting a user.
```md
1. Adding a user as a friend or removing them from your friends list.
2. Creating or deleting thoughts to share with other users in the database.
3. Creating or deleting reactions to said user posts.
```
