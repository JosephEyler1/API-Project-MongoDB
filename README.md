### API SEARCH PROJECT

This is my API project which allows users to do plenty of things relating to user interactivity! Several of these features are: 
Creating, editing, or deleting a user
Adding a user as a friend or removing them from your freinds list
Creating or deleting thoughts to share with other users in the database
Creating or deleting reactions to said user posts
